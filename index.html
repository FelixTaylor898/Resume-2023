      <h2>Hello world!</h2>
      <p>I'm <strong>Felix Taylor</strong>, a 23-year-old computer scientist. Welcome to my personal website, which
        serves as an informal
        resume to help employers get to know me better. This is currently a WIP, and I am building it from scratch.</p>
      <p>My journey into programming began in high school when I took computer science electives and discovered my deep
        passion and natural talent for it. One of my older sisters attended <strong>James Madison University</strong>,
        so I
        decided to pursue my education there as well. At JMU, I received a comprehensive education in computer science,
        covering a wide range of topics that provided me with a well-rounded understanding of the field. I developed
        proficiency in multiple programming languages and technologies, and discovered that I have a remarkable ability
        to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to new projects. This allowed me to consistently deliver my work ahead
        of schedule, giving me extra time to thoroughly test and optimize my deliverables. I graduated cum laude in May
        2022 and was enrolled into Upsilon Pi Epsilon due to my academic performance.</p>
      <p>Following my graduation, I joined <strong>Hexaware Technologies</strong> as a full-stack Java developer. I
        underwent an
        intensive training program where I acquired expertise in Spring Boot, Angular, various database systems, and
        AWS. Over the course of a year, I actively participated in various projects, contributing as a full-stack
        developer. During periods of downtime, I took the initiative to improve the codebase by cleaning, optimizing,
        debugging, and testing both my own code and that of my colleagues. In addition to my work at Hexaware, I pursued
        training in Microsoft Azure and obtained a certification.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, despite the training and performance of myself and my peers, the company made the decision to
        let go of many associates in my hiring pool, expressing a preference for overseas developers. As a result, I am
        now seeking a remote
        computer science role that will challenge me and provide constant opportunities for growth, ensuring that I
        never become stagnant in my skillset. With my unwavering passion for coding, continuous learning, and
        collaborative nature, I am confident that I can bring a unique and valuable perspective to any team.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting this site. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and enthusiasm
        to your organization.</p>
