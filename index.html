      <h2>Hello world!</h2>
      <p>I'm <strong>Felix Taylor</strong>, a 23-year-old computer scientist. I've created this (WIP) personal website as an
        informal resume so you can get to know me beyound my job qualifications.</p>
      <p>My journey into programming began in high school when I took computer science electives and discovered my deep
        passion and natural talent for it. At <strong>James Madison University</strong>, I received a comprehensive
        education in computer science,
        covering a wide range of topics that provided me with a well-rounded understanding of the field. I developed
        proficiency in multiple programming languages and technologies, including Java, Python, and C. I discovered that
        I have a remarkable ability
        to quickly grasp new concepts and adapt to new projects. This allowed me to consistently deliver my work ahead
        of schedule, giving me extra time to thoroughly test and optimize my deliverables. I graduated cum laude in May
        2022 and was enrolled into <a href="https://upe.acm.org/" target="_blank">Upsilon Pi Epsilon</a> due to my academic performance.
      </p>
      <p>Following my graduation, I joined <strong>Hexaware Technologies</strong> as a full-stack Java developer. I
        completed an
        intensive training program and acquired expertise in Spring Boot, Angular, various database systems, and
        AWS. Over the course of a year, I actively participated in various projects, contributing as a full-stack
        developer. During periods of downtime, I took the initiative to improve the codebase by cleaning, optimizing,
        debugging, and testing both my own code and that of my colleagues.</p>
      <p>I am
         seeking a remote
        computer science role that will challenge me and provide consistent opportunities for growth. With my unwavering
        passion for coding, continuous learning, and
        collaborative nature, I am confident that I can bring a unique and valuable perspective to any team.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting this site. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and enthusiasm
        to your organization.</p>
