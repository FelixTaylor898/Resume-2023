      <p>What better place to study than the peaceful mountains of Harrisonburg, VA?</p>
      <p>Embarking on my collegiate journey in August 2018, I was filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation.
        Having graduated from high school with an advanced diploma and an impressive attendance record, missing only a
        single day, I was determined to continue my academic success in college.
        However, during the first few semesters,
        I found myself grappling with personal issues that impacted my ability to perform at my desired level.
        I made a conscious decision to persevere and overcome the obstacles that stood in my way. Through sheer
        determination and a renewed focus, I was able to achieve remarkable results. The
        recognition I received in the form of <strong>one dean's list honor and three president's list honors</strong>
        served as a
        testament to the progress I had made, as well as enrollment into <strong><a href="https://upe.acm.org/">Upsilon
            Pi
            Epsilon</a></strong>.</p>
      <p>Graduating <strong>cum laude</strong> in May 2022 was a crowning achievement, symbolizing the culmination of
        years of hard work and
        dedication. This
        achievement not only reflected my academic success but also served as a testament to the personal growth and
        resilience I had cultivated throughout my collegiate journey.</p>

      <h2>Bachelor of Science - Computer Science</h2>
      <p>JMU's Computer Science program has equipped me with a deep knowledge and understanding of various programming languages,
        technologies, and conceptual topics.</p>
      <p>Throughout my time in the program, I was exposed to a wide range of programming languages, including Java,
        Python, C, and JavaScript. This diverse exposure allowed me to develop a versatile skill set,
        enabling me to write efficient and effective code in any language. In addition to language proficiency, the
        program also emphasized the importance of creating clean and optimized
        code. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I learned the significance of writing code that is not
        only functional but also maintainable, scalable, and efficient. Concepts such as data structures, algorithms,
        and software design principles were thoroughly covered, providing me with the tools necessary to
        craft high-quality code.</p>
      <p>Working on team projects provided me with invaluable opportunities to
        collaborate with peers, refine my problem-solving skills, and apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios. These
        experiences not only enhanced my technical abilities but also fostered crucial soft skills such as
        communication, teamwork, and project management.</p>
      <p>Overall, JMU's Computer Science program shaped me into a well-rounded
        and proficient programmer. The emphasis on both theoretical concepts and practical application has
        equipped me with the skills and mindset necessary to thrive in the ever-evolving field of technology. With a
        robust understanding of programming languages, technologies, and conceptual topics, I am confident in my ability
        to write efficient code and continue learning and growing as a programmer.</p>
